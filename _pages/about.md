I’m Imene (pronounced _/iman/_), I’m currently a second year PhD Student at INSA Lyon and Esker. My work focuses on NLP and Agents for Web navigation.

I worked as a Data Scientist for almost 2 years before starting my PhD, it was a great experience in industry, although I prefer research as it is more interesting and challenging.

I enjoy NLP related subjects and open-source, I worked on the MTEB extension to French, and I am actively contributing to the maintainance of the MTEB package.

Aside from research, I enjoy hiking, reading interesting books, asking questions and painting.
